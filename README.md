The contribution of epigenomic drivers to the development of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSC) remains rudimentary. Here, we generated 89 chromatin maps to characterize the epigenetic states in 26 primary HGSCs. Integrated analyses identified gene sets and pathways regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, revealing that genes involved in signaling and stress response were more strongly associated with chromatin features than with copy number alterations. These chromatin modification states may confer transcriptional plasticity, enabling cells to adapt to cellular stressors such as nutrient deprivation or chemotherapy. Using two orthogonal approaches, we defined molecular subgroups based on regulatory elements. Notably, enhancer cluster 2 (EpiC2), was associated with worse survival, an observation that replicated in an independent cohort of 338 tumors. EpiC2 was associated with lower homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and reduced immune infiltration. Enhancer cluster 1 (EpiC1) was associated with the regulation of immunomodulatory genes, whereas EpiC2 enhancers were enriched proximal to genes involved in cellular plasticity, including transmembrane transport channels. Cell line models of EpiC2 showed responsiveness to the multichannel blocker dronedarone, suggesting potential repurposing of this drug for HGSC treatment. Overall, we define a precision medicine approach based on chromatin-based biomarkers for HGSC.
